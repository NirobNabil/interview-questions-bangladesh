## Software Engineering Questions

> all code related answers can be answered in any language but python is preferred

<article>

Given an integer N, find all the divisors of N.
</article>

<article>

Given two sorted arrays A and B, combine all the elements of A and B into a new sorted array C.
</article>

<article>

For a binary tree, you are given a table of two columns N and P, where N represents the id of a node in the tree and P represents the parent of that node in the tree. Write a SQL query to find which the `leaf`, `root` and `inner` nodes and output a table fo the following format

| N         | NodeType                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 5 | root |
| 2   | inner |
| 3   | leaf |
| 4   | leaf |
| 8   | inner |
| 6   | leaf |

## Machine Learning Questions

<article>

You are given realtime 120FPS CCTV footage of cars on a road. Assuming you have a model that can accurately identify cars and output an axis oriented bounding box for every detected car on a single frame. 

You have to detect how many distinct cars that camera has seen in a given timeframe, say within an hour. Given that after a car leaves the camera's field of view, it doesn't appear again. 

Describe how you would approach this problem.
</article>

<article>

You need to create a model that classified news articles into three categories, 
- sports
- politics
- entertainment

You have large amount of data but there is no labelled data.
The model has to handle very high throughput of hundreds of articles per second at inference time.

Describe how you would approach this problem.
</article>

<article>

Given model's training and validation accuracy/loss curve, describe what the graph tells about the model and explain your reasoning. Also describe how you can mitigate the issue the model is facing.
</article>

<article>

Explain in brief any one research paper you read recently about ML. briefly describe it's methodology, findings and show atleast one real world implication of the paper.
